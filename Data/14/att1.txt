hectares.

Group to produce and sell electricity at a "green tariff'. The group used one of the most common technologies
for the combustion of husk sunflower, which was previously consider waste. For this , the Group purchased
and installed two steam boiler units, a steam generation capacity of 16 tons I hour each and one condensing
steam turbo generator with an electric capacity of 7 MW. This decision created all the
conditions for entering non-waste production.

       The Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information
        included in the Consolidated Management Report, but does not include the consolidated financial statements
       and our auditor's report thereon.
       Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not ex-
        press any form of assurance conclusion thereon .
        In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other
        information and , in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the con-
       solidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially
        misstated . If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of
       this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
        Responsibilities of the Board of Directors for the Consolidated Financial Statements
       The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements that give a true
       and fair view in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European
        Union and the requirements of the Cyprus Companies Law, Cap. 113, and for such internal control as the
        Board of Directors determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that
       are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
        In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Board of Directors is responsible for assessing the
       Group's ability to continue as a going concern , disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and
        using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Group
       or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
       The Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing the Group's financial reporting process.

                       ~PROIOS
       Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
       Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a
       whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that
        includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit
       conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements
       can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could rea-
       sonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated
       financial statements.
              •      Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements,
                     whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and
                     obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of
                     not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error,
                     as fraud may involve collusion , forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of
                     internal control.
              •      Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures
                     that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
                     effectiveness of the Group's internal control.
              •      Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting esti-
                     mates and related disclosures made by the Board of Directors.
              •      Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors' use of the going concern basis of account-
                     ing and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events
                     or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern . If
                     we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report
                     to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inade-
                     quate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date
                     of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue
                     as a going concern.
              •      Evaluate the overall presentation , structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, in-
                     cluding the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying
                     transactions and events in a manner that achieves a true and fair view.
              •      Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or busi-
                     ness activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We
                     are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely
                     responsible for our audit opinion .
       We communicate with the Board of Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing
       of the audit and significant audit findings , including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify
       during our audit.
       We also provide the Board of Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical require-
        ments regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may
        reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
        From the matters communicated with the Board of Directors, we determine those matters that were of most
       significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the
        key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public
       disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not
        be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected
       to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication .

2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set
out below. These policies have been consistently applied to all years presented in these consolidated financial
statements unless otherwise stated.
Basis of preparation
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Re-
porting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union (EU) and the requirements of the Cyprus Com-
panies Law, Cap.113. These consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost
convention with the exception of biological assets have been prepared under fair value.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires the use of certain critical accounting
estimates and requires Management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying the Group's accounting
policies. It also requires the use of assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Although these estimates are based on Management's
best knowledge of current events and actions, actual results may ultimately differ from those estimates.
Adoption of the standards and interpretations during the reporting period
In the current year the Group has applied all new and revised standards and interpretations adopted by the
International Accounting Standards Board and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee
which are to be applied in financial statements for the periods beginning on or after 1 January 2020.
As at the date of approval of these financial statements, the following standards, interpretations and changes
to the standards have been issued, but are not effective yet:
                                                        14

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Year ended 31 December 2020
Amendments to IFRS 3: Definition of a Business
The amendment to IFRS 3 Business Combinations clarifies that to be considered a business, an integrated
set of activities and assets must include, at a minimum , an input and a substantive process that, together,
significantly contribute to the ability to create output. Furthermore, it clarifies that a business can exist without
including all of the inputs and processes needed to create outputs. These amendments had no impact on the
consolidated financial statements of the Group, but may impact future periods should the Group enter into any
business combinations .
Amendments to IFRS 7, IFRS 9 and IAS 39 Interest Rate Benchmark Reform
The amendments to IFRS 9 and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement provide a num-
ber of reliefs, which apply to all hedging relationships that are directly affected by interest rate benchmark
reform. A hedging relationship is affected if the reform gives rise to uncertainty about the timing and/or amount
of benchmark-based cash flows of the hedged item or the hedging instrument. These amendments have no
impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group as it does not have any interest rate hedge
relationships.
Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8 Definition of Material
The amendments provide a new definition of material that states, "information is material if omitting, misstating
or obscuring it could reasonably be expected to influence decisions that the primary users of general purpose
financial statements make on the basis of those financial statements, which provide financial information about
a specific reporting entity ." The amendments clarify that materiality will depend on the nature or magnitude of
information, either individually or in combination with other information, in the context of the financial state-
ments. A misstatement of information is material if it could reasonably be expected to influence decisions made
by the primary users. These amendments had no impact on the consolidated financial statements of, nor is
there expected to be any future impact to the Group.
Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting issued on 29 March 2018
The Conceptual Framework is not a standard, and none of the concepts contained there in override the con -
cepts or requirements in any standard. The purpose of the Conceptual Framework is to assist the IASB in
developing standards, to help preparers develop cons istent accounting policies where there is no applicable
standard in place and to assist all parties to understand and interpret the standards. This will affect those
entities which developed their accounting policies based on the Conceptual Framework. The revised
Conceptual Framework includes some new concepts , updated definitions and recognition criteria for assets
and liabilities and clarifies some important concepts. These amendments had no impact on the consolidated
financial statements of the Group.
Amendments to IFRS 16 Covid-19 Related Rent Concessions
On 28 May 2020, the IASB issued Covid-19-Related Rent Concessions - amendment to IFRS 16 Leases The
amendments provide relief to lessees from applying IFRS 16 guidance on lease modification accounting for
rent concessions arising as a direct consequence of the Covid-19 pandemic. As a practical expedient, a lessee
may elect not to assess whether a Covid-19 related rent concession from a lessor is a lease modification. A
lessee that makes this election accounts for any change in lease payments resulting from the Covid-19 related
rent concession the same way it would account for the change under IFRS 16, if the change were not a lease
modification.
Standards issued but not yet effective
The amendment applies to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 June 2020 . Earlier application is
 permitted . This amendment had no impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.

IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts
In May 2017, the IASB issued IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts (IFRS 17), a comprehensive new accounting
standard for insurance contracts covering recognition and measurement, presentation and disclosure. Once
effective, IFRS 17 will replace IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts (IFRS 4) that was issued in 2005 . IFRS 17 applies
to all types of insurance contracts (i.e., life, non-life, direct insurance and re-insurance) , regardless of the type
of entities that issue them, as well as to certain guarantees and financial instruments with discretionary partic-
ipation features.
A few scope exceptions will apply . The overall objective of IFRS 17 is to provide an accounting model for
insurance contracts that is more useful and consistent for insurers. In contrast to the requirements in IFRS 4,
wh ich are largely based on grandfathering previous local accounting policies, IFRS 17 provides a comprehen-
sive model for insurance contracts, covering all relevant accounting aspects. The core of IFRS 17 is the general
model , supplemented by:
-A specific adaptation for contracts with direct participation features (the variable fee approach)
-A simplified approach (the premium allocation approach) mainly for short-duration contracts
IFRS 17 is effective for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023, with comparative figures re-
quired. Early application is permitted, provided the entity also applies IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 on or before the
date it first applies IFRS 17. This standard is not applicable to the Group.
Amendments to IAS 1: Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current
In January 2020, the IASB issued amendments to paragraphs 69 to 76 of IAS 1 to specify the requirements
for classifying liabilities as current or non-current. The amendments clarify:
- What is meant by a right to defer settlement
- That a right to defer must exist at the end of the reporting period
- That classification is unaffected by the likelihood that an entity will exercise its deferral right
- That only if an embedded derivative in a convertible liability is itself an equity instrument would the terms of
a liability not impact its classification
The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023 and must be
applied retrospectively. The Group is currently assessing the impact the amendments will have on current
 practice and whether existing loan agreements may require renegotiation .
 Reference to the Conceptual Framework -Amendments to IFRS 3
 In May 2020, the IASB issued Amendments to IFRS 3 Business Combinations - Reference to the Conceptual
 Framework. The amendments are intended to replace a reference to the Framework for the Preparation and
 Presentation of Financial Statements, issued in 1989, with a reference to the Conceptual Framework for
 Financial Reporting issued in March 2018 without significantly changing its requirements.
The Board also added an exception to the recognition principle of IFRS 3 to avoid the issue of potential 'day
2' gains or losses arising for liabilities and contingent liabilities that would be with in the scope of IAS 37 or
 IFRIC 21 Levies, if incurred separately.
At the same time, the Board decided to clarify existing guidance in IFRS 3 for contingent assets that would not
 be affected by replacing the reference to the Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial
 Statements. The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022
 and apply prospectively.

Property, Plant and Equipment: Proceeds before Intended Use - Amendments to IAS 16
In May 2020, the IASB issued Property, Plant and Equipment - Proceeds before Intended Use, which pro-
hibits entities deducting from the cost of an item of property, plant and equipment, any proceeds from selling
items produced while bringing that asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operat-
ing in the manner intended by management. Instead, an entity recognises the proceeds from selling such
items, and the costs of producing those items, in profit or loss.
The amendment is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022 and must be
applied retrospectively to items of property, plant and equipment made available for use on or after the begin-
ning of the earliest period presented when the entity first applies the amendment. The amendments are not
expected to have a material impact on the Group.
Onerous Contracts - Costs of Fulfilling a Contract - Amendments to IAS 37
In May 2020, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 37 to specify which costs an entity needs to include when
assessing whether a contract is onerous or loss-making. The amendments apply a "directly related cost ap-
proach''. The costs that relate directly to a contract to provide goods or services include both incremental costs
and an allocation of costs directly related to contract activities. General and administrative costs do not relate
directly to a contract and are excluded unless they are explicitly chargeable to the counterparty under the
contract.
The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022. The Group
will apply these amendments to contracts for which it has not yet fulfilled all its obligations at the beginning of
the annual reporting period in which it first applies the amendments.
IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards - Subsidiary as a first-time adopter
As part of its 2018-2020 annual improvements to IFRS standards process, the IASB issued an amendment to
IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards. The amendment permits a subsid-
iary that elects to apply paragraph D16(a) of IFRS 1 to measure cumulative translation differences using the
amounts reported by the parent, based on the parent's date of transition to IFRS. This amendment is also
applied to an associate or joint venture that elects to apply paragraph D16(a) of IFRS 1. The amendment is
effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022 with earlier a doption permitted.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments - Fees in the '10 per cent' test for derecognition of financial liabilities
As part of its 2018-2020 annual improvements to IFRS standards process the IASB issued amendment to
IFRS 9. The amendment clarifies the fees that an entity includes when assessing whether the terms of a new
or modified financial liability are substantially different from the terms of the original financial liability. These
fees include only those paid or received between the borrower and the lender, including fees paid or received
by either the borrower or lender on the other's behalf. An entity applies the amendment to financial liabilities
that are modified or exchanged on or after the beginning of the annual reporting period in which the entity first
applies the amendment.
The amendment is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022 with earlier
adoption permitted. The Group will apply the amendments to financial liabilities that are modified or exchanged
on or after the beginning of the annual reporting period in which the entity first applies the amendment. The
amendments are not expected to have a material impact on the Group.
IAS 41 Agriculture - Taxation in fair value measurements
As part of its 2018-2020 annual improvements to IFRS standards process the IASB issued amendment to IAS
41 Agriculture. The amendment removes the requirement in paragraph 22 of IAS 41 that entities exclude cash
flows for taxation when measuring the fair value of assets within the scope of IAS 41.
An entity applies the amendment prospectively to fair value measurements on or after the beginning of the first
annual reporting period beginning on or after 1 January 2022 with earlier adoption permitted. The amendments
are not expected to have a material impact on the Group.

The Group consolidated financia l statements comprise the financial statements of the parent company Agroliga
Group Pie. and the financial statements of the Ukrainian companies Agroliga Group LLC, PLC Liga-A, Agrocom
NV LLC , PLC Mechnikovo, Agroliga LLC, Vostokagrokontract LLC, Mayak LLC, Limited Liability Company
"Agroliga Polska", "Agroliga-Trade" LLC and AGL ENERGY, LLC, Liga Trade TH , LLC
The financial statements of all the Group companies are prepared using uniform accounting policies. All in-
ter-company transactions and balances between Group companies have been eliminated during consolidation .
Business combinations
Acquisitions of businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred in a
business combination is measured at fair value, which is calculated as the sum of the acquisition-date fa ir
values of the assets transferred by the Group, liabilities incurred by the Group to the former owners of the
acquiree and the equity interests issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition-re-
lated costs are generally recognized in profit or loss as incurred .
At the acquisition date, the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed are recognized at their fair
value at the acquisition date, except that:
•         deferred tax assets or liabilities and liabilities or assets related to employee benefit arrangements are
          recognized and measured in accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes and IAS 19 Employee Benefits
          respectively;
•         liabilities or equity instruments related to share-based payment arrangements of the acquiree or
          share-based payment arrangements of the Group entered into to replace share-based payment ar-
          rangements of the acquiree are measured in accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based Payment at the
          acquisition date; and
•         assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current
          Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations are measured in accordance with that Standard .
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-con-
trolling interests in the acquiree, and the fair value of the acquirer's previously held equity interest in the ac-
quiree (if any) over the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities
assumed. If, after reassessment, the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired
and liabilities assumed exceeds the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling
interests in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer's previously held interest in the acquiree (if any), the
excess is recognized immediately in profit or loss as a bargain purchase gain.
Non-controlling interests that are present ownership interests and entitle their holders to a proportionate share
of the entity's net assets in the event of liquidation may be initially measured either at fair value or at the
non-controlling interests' proportionate share of the recognized amounts of the acquiree's identifiable net as-
sets. The choice of measurement basis is made on a transaction-by-transaction basis. Other types of non-con-
trolling interests are measured at fair value or, when applicable, on the basis specified in another IFRS.
When the consideration transferred by the Group in a business combination includes assets or liabilities re-
sulting from a contingent consideration arrangement, the contingent consideration is measured at its acquisi-
tion-date fair value and included as part of the consideration transferred in a business combination. Changes
in the fair value of the contingent consideration that qualify as measurement period adjustments are adjusted
retrospectively, with corresponding adjustments against goodwill. Measurement period adjustments are ad-
justments that arise from additional information obtained during the 'measurement period' (which cannot ex-
ceed one year from the acquisition date) about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date.
The subsequent accounting for changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration that do not qualify as
measurement period adjustments depends on how the contingent consideration is classified . Contingent con-
sideration that is classified as equity is not remeasured at subsequent reporting dates and its subsequent
settlement is accounted for with in equity. Contingent consideration that is classified as an asset or a liability is
remeasured at subsequent reporting dates in accordance with IAS 39, or IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Lia-
bilities and Contingent Assets, as appropriate, with the corresponding gain or loss being recognized in profit
or loss.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Year ended 31 December 2020
When a business combination is achieved in stages, the Group's previously held equity interest in the acquiree
is re-measured to fair value at the acquisition date (i.e. the date when the Group obtains control) and the
resulting gain or loss, if any , is recognized in profit or loss. Amounts arising from interests in the acquiree prior
to the acquisition date that have previously been recognized in other comprehensive income are reclassified
to profit or loss where such treatment would be appropriate if that interest were disposed of.
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the
combination occurs, the Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incom-
plete. Those provisional amounts are adjusted during the measurement period (see above) , or additional as-
sets or liabilities are recognised, to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed
at the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amounts recognized at that date.
Business combinations that took place prior to 1 January 2010 were accounted for in accordance with the
previous version of IFRS 3.
Revenue recognition
Revenue comprises the invoiced amount for the sale of products net of Value Added Tax, rebates and dis-
counts. Revenues earned by the Group are recognized on the following bases:
•         Sale of products
          Sales of products are recognized when significant risks and rewards of ownership of the products have
          been transferred to the customer, which is usually when the Group has sold or delivered the products
          to the customer, the customer has accepted the products and collectability of the related receivable is
          reasonably assured .
•         Interest income
          Interest income is recognized on a time-proportion basis using the effective interest method.
Finance costs
Interest expense and other borrowing costs are charged to profit or loss as incurred .
Foreign currency translation
Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the Group's financial statements are measured using the currency of the primary economic
environment in which the entity operates ('the functional currency'). The financial statements are presented in
Euro (€'000), which is the Group's presentation currency .
All amounts of these consolidated financial statements are accounted in local cu rrency of each of the company
of the Group ("the functional currency"). The functional currency of each of the Group companies is indicated

Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate at the
end of the reporting period .
The Ukrainian hryvnia is not a freely convertible currency outside of Ukraine, therefore, in accordingly conver-
sion of UAH in EUR should be treated as amounts in UAH have been , can be or will be in the future converted
into EUR at the determined rate or any other exchange rate.
Tax
Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Current tax liabilities and assets are measured at the amount expected to be paid to or recovered from the
taxation authorities, using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted, or substantively enacted, by the
reporting date.
Deferred tax is provided in full , using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax
bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. Currently enacted tax
rates are used in the determination of deferred tax.
Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available
against which the temporary differences can be utilized.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax
assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred taxes relate to the same fiscal authority.
Dividends
Dividend distribution to the Group's shareholders is recognized in the Group's financial statements in the year
in which they are approved by the Board of Directors.
Biological assets
Livestock are measured at their fair value less estimated point-of-sale costs. The fair value of livestock is
determined based on market prices of livestock of similar age, breed, and genetic merit. Milk is initially meas-
ured at its fair value less estimated point-of-sale costs at the time of milking. The fair value of milk is determined
based on market prices in the local area.

Year ended 31 December 2020
Property, plant and equipment
Property , plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated
impairment losses.
Properties in the course of construction for production, rental or administrative purposes, or for purposes not
yet determined, are carried at cost, less any recognized impairment loss. Cost includes professional fees and,
for qualifying assets, borrowing costs capitalized in accordance with the Group's accounting policy. Deprecia-
tion of these assets, on the same basis as other property assets, commences when the assets are ready for
their intended use.
Depreciation is calculated on the straight-line method so as to write off the cost of each asset to its residual
value over its estimated useful life. The annual depreciation rates used are as follows:
                                                                                                               %

Motor vehicles and other fixed assets                                                                       10-20
Production equipment                                                                                         5-10
The assets residual va lues and useful lives are rev iewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each reporting date.
Where the carrying amount of an asset is greater than its estimated recoverable amount, the asset is written
down immediately to its recoverable amount.
Expenditure for repairs and maintenance of property , plant and equipment is charged to profit or loss of the
year in which it is incurred. The cost of major renovations and other subsequent expenditure are included in
the carry ing amount of the asset when it is probable that future economic benefits in excess of the originally
assessed standard of performance of the existing asset will flow to the Group. Major renovations are depreci-
ated over the remaining useful life of the related asset.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognized upon disposal or when no future economic benefits
are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement
of an item of property , plant and equipment is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and
the carrying amount of the asset and is recognized in profit or loss.
Deferred income from government grants
Government grants on non-current assets acquisitions are credited to profit or loss in instalments over the
estimated useful economic lives of the correspond ing assets. This is achieved by deducting grants from the
book value of these assets and the recognition of income through the reduced depreciation charge. Grants
are recognized when there is reasonable assurance that the Group w ill comply with the conditions attaching
to them and that the grants will be received. Government grants that relate to expenses are recognized in profit
or loss as revenue.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognized in the Group's consolidated statement of financial po-
sition when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are measured at in itial recognition at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortized
cost using the effective interest rate method. Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are
recognized in profit or loss when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired . The allowance recog-
nized is measured as the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the present value of estimated
future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition.
Prepayments from clients
Payments received in advance on sale contracts for which no revenue has been recognized yet, are recorded
as prepayments from clients as at the reporting date and carried under liabilities.

AGROLIGA GROUP PLC
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Year ended 31 December 2020
Loans granted
Loans originated by the Group by providing money directly to the borrower are categorized as loans and are
carried at amortized cost. The amortized cost is the amount at which the loan granted is measured at initial
recognition minus principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortization using the effective interest
method of any difference between the initial amount and the maturity amount, and minus any reduction for
impairment or uncollectible. All loans are recognized when cash is advanced to the borrower.
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortized cost of a financial asset or a financial
liability (or group of financial assets or financial liabilities) and of allocating the interest income or interest
expense over the relevant period . The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future
cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument or, when appropriate, a shorter
period to the net carryi ng amount of the financial asset or financial liability.
Cash and cash equivalents
For the purpose of the consolidated statement of cash flows , cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at
bank and in hand.
Borrowings
Borrowings are recorded initially at the proceeds received, net of transaction costs incurred . Borrowings are
subsequently stated at amortized cost. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the
redemption value is recognized in profit or loss over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest
method .
Trade payables
Trade payables are initially measured at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortized cost, using
the effective interest rate method .
Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities
Financial assets
A financial asset (or, where applicable a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets)
is derecognized when:
•         the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired;
•         the Group retains the right to receive cash flows from the asset, but has assumed an obligation to pay
          them in full without material delay to a third party under a 'pass through' arrangement; or
•         the Group has transferred its rights to rece ive cash flows from the asset and either (a) has transferred
          substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) has neither transferred nor retained substan-
          tially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.
Financial liabilities
A financial liability is derecognize when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.
When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms,
or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a
derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, and the difference in the respective
carrying amounts is recognized in profit or loss.
Impairment of assets
Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment.
Assets that are subject to depreciation or amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or
changes in ci rcumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is
recog nized for the amount by which the asset's carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recov-
erable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs to sell and value in use. For the purposes of
assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash
flows (cash-generating units).

Offsetting financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabi lities are offset and the net amount reported in the consolidated statement
of financial position if, and only if, there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognized amounts
and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
This is not generally the case with master netting agreements, and the related assets and liabilities are pre-
sented gross in the consolidated statement of financial position .
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The cost is determined using the
first-in-first-out basis with the exception of Vostokagrokontrakt which uses the weighted average method. The
costs of finished goods and semi-finished goods comprises materials, direct labour, other direct costs and
related production overheads (based on normal operating activity) but excludes borrowing costs. Net realizab le
value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the costs to completion and selling
expenses.
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. The difference between the fair value of the consideration received
by the Company and the nominal value of the share capital being issued is taken to the share premium account.
Non-current liabilities
Non-current liabilities represent amounts that are due more than twelve months from the reporting date.
Comparatives
Where necessary, comparative figures have been adjusted to conform to changes in presentation in the current
year.
Lease
Determining whether a transaction is a lease, or whether it contains lease attributes, is based on an analysis
of the transaction content. A contract as a whole or its individual components is a lease agreement if this
agreement transfers the right to control the use of the identified asset for a certain period in exchange for a
refund.
Group as a lessee
At commencement of the lease term, the lessee measures the right-of-use asset at the initial cost, which should
include the following :
- the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability;
- lease payments at or prior to commencement, net of discounts received;
- any initial direct costs incurred by the lessee;
- the measurement of the costs that will be incurred by the lessee when dismantling and moving the underlying
asset after the contract termination .
At commencement of the lease term, the lease liabi lity is initially measured by the Group at the present value
of the lease payments payable over the lease term. Lease payments are discounted at the interest rate implicit
in the lease agreement. If such a rate cannot be readily determined, the Group uses the effective interest rate
for attracting additional borrowings in the same currency calculated from the latest annual or interim statements
prepared on the date of the agreement.
The right-of-use assets are recognised in the lessee's statement of financial position separately from other
assets.
The Group does not apply the above-mentioned requ irements for the recognition of assets and liabilities for
short-term leases or leases in which the underlying asset has a value of less than 5 thousand Euros. The
lessee recognizes lease payments for such leases as expenses on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Group as a lessor
Leases in which the Group does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of
the asset are classified as operating lease. Initial direct costs incurred when entering into an operating lease
are included in the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognized over the lease term in proportion to
the lease income. Contingent lease payments are recognized as income in the period in which they were
accrued .
3. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
Financial risk factors
The Group is influenced by interest rate risk, credit, liquidity, liquidity risk, currency risk and capital manage-
ment due to the existence of financial instruments. Information concerning the influence of these risks on the
Group, goals of the Group, its policy and procedures of risk measurement and management are disclosed in
the notes below:
3.1 Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of financial instruments will fluctuate due to changes in market interest
rates. Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk. Borrowings issued
at fixed rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk. The Group's management monitors the interest
rate fluctuations on a continuous basis and acts accord ing ly.
3.2 Credit risk
Credit risk is a risk of financial losses of the Group in the case of counterpart's failure of comply ing with liabilities
to the Group in accordance with the contract. In the reporting financial period, assets of the Group which are
subject to such risk are represented by cash in bank, trade and other receivables (except receivables, which
are not financial assets by nature).
Sensitivity to credit risk
Carrying amount of financial assets is the maximum value, which is a subject to financial risk. Maximum value

of the Group to credit risk mainly depends on features of each client.
3.3 Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk of failure of complying with Group's financial liabilities at the date of their settlement.
Group's approach to liquidity management consists in securing (as much as possible) constant presence of
liquidity, which would make possible to settle liabilities in time (both in regular conditions, and in extraord inary
ones), allowing to avoid additional costs or damage of Group reputation.
Management of the Group is liable for maintaining the requ ired level of liquidity. Related structure of maintain-
ing of the Group's requirements of short- and long-term financing and for liquidity control was developed by
the management of the Group. The Group manages this risk by maintaining sufficient reserves, utilization of
bank resources and loans. It mon itors also the planned and actual cash flows , matches inflow and outflow of
cash .
Liquidity analysis is to compare assets, grouped according to their degree of liquid ity and arranged in descend-
ing order of liquidity , with liabilities, grouped by maturity dates and arranged in ascending order of maturity .

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Year ended 31 December 2020
The term EBITDA means an analytical indicator, equal to the amount of profit before accrued interest ex-
penses, taxes and depreciation deductions. There were no changes in approaches to capital management in
reporting periods. In 2020, EBITDA indicator has significantly decreased compared with 2019 by EUR 4 049
thousand .
4. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS
Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors,
including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will
by definition, seldom equal the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant
risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial
year are discussed below:
Provision for bad and doubtful debts
The Group reviews its trade and other receivables for evidence of their recoverability . Such evidence includes
the customer's payment record and the customer's overall financial position. If indications of irrecoverability
exist, the recoverable amount is estimated and a respective provision for bad and doubtful debts is made. The
amount of the provision is charged through profit or loss. The review of credit risk is continuous and the meth-
odology and assumptions used for estimating the provision are reviewed regularly and adjusted accordingly .
Provision for obsolete and slow-moving inventory
The Group reviews its inventory records for evidence regarding the saleability of inventory and its net realizable
value on disposal. The provision for obsolete and slow-moving inventory is based on Management's past ex-
perience, taking into consideration the value of inventory as well as the movement and the level of stock of
each category of inventory.
The amount of provision is recognized in profit or loss. The review of the net realizable value of the inventory
is continuous and the methodology and assumptions used for estimating the provision for obsolete and
slow-moving inventory are reviewed regularly and adjusted accordingly.
Income taxes
Significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes. There are transactions and
calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business. The
Group recognizes liabi lities for anticipated tax audit issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will
be due. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded,
such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determina-
tion is made.
Impairment of non-financial assets
The impairment test is performed using the discounted cash flows expected to be generated through the use
of non-financial assets, using a discount rate that reflects the current market estimations and the risks associ-
ated with the asset. When it is impractical to estimate the recoverable amount of an asset, the Group estimates
the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit in which the asset belongs to.

18. DEFERRED TAXES
Deferred tax calculated in full on all temporary differences under the liability method using the applicable tax
rates (Note 9). The applicable corporation tax rate in the case of tax losses is 12,5% and 18% for the Cyprus
and Ukrainian entities respectively.
Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available,
against which the temporary differences can be utilised .
Deferred tax assets and liabilities offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets
against current tax liabilities and when the deferred taxes relate to the same fiscal authority.
The movement on the deferred taxation account is as follows :

20. OPERATING ENVIRONMENT OF THE GROUP
The Group operates in Ukraine. The political and economic situation in the country in 2020 was largely deter-
mined by factors that arose in 2014-2015 and were characterized by instability, which led to a deterioration of
the state of public finances , volatility of financial markets, ii liquidity of capital markets, increased inflation and
currency devaluation in relation to major foreign currencies.
The Government of Ukraine continues to implement a comprehensive structural reform program aimed at
eliminating existing imbalances in the economy, public finances and governance, fighting corruption, and re-
forming the judiciary with the ultimate goal of providing the conditions for economic recovery in the country.
The weakness of the national currency combined with restrictions on international payments, the negative
balance of foreign trade, continuing volatility in the country 's traditional export markets, and high inflation are
key risks to stabilize the operating environment in Ukraine in the near future. Further support from the IMF and
other international donors depends on maintaining the dynamics of the structural reforms mentioned above.
In preparing these financial statements, the known and estimated results of these factors for the financial
position and the results of the Group's activities in the reporting period have been taken into account.
Management cannot anticipate all changes that may have an impact on the economy as a whole, as well as
what effects they may have on the Group's financial position in the future. Management believes that they are
taking all necessary steps to support the Group's stable operations and development.
These financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from such uncertainty. Such ad-
justments will be notified if they become known and can be evaluated .

22. RIGHT-OF-USE ASSET AND LEASE LIABILITY
The Group leases land. The relationship is formed by lease agreements for a period of 2 to 99 years, followed
by an extension of the term by concluding additional agreements. Changing the terms of contracts and their
early termination is possible by agreement of the parties or by a court decision. Under contracts, the group
does not have the right to leaseback transactions after the lease term expires.
Obligations under lease agreements are repaid in UAH.
Lease payments are discounted at the interest rate implicit in the lease agreement. If such a rate cannot be
readily determined, the Company uses the effective interest rate for attracting additional borrowings in the
same currency calculated from the latest annual or interim statements prepared on the date of the agreement.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Year ended 31 December 2020
significant. No provision has been made in these financial statements in respect of this matter.
24. COMMITMENTS
The Group had no capital or other commitments as at 31 December 2020.
25. GOING CONCERN
At the end of 2019 the new virus Covid-19 has begun to spread worldwide - firstly the World Health Organiza-
tion reported a limited number of cases of COVID-19 infection, but on January 31, 2020 declared an emer-
gency in the field of health care, and on March 13, 2020 - the beginning of the pandemic due to the rapid
spread of COVID-19 in Europe and other regions. All over the world a significant number of companies are
forced to discontinue or limit their operations to an undefined time at the time of preparation of these financial
statements due to the preventive measures and quarantine restriction.
The management of the Group is doing its best to remain both in compliance with regulations and safe for
continued operations trying to reduce the negative impact of the pandemic and is confident that the current
uncertainty will not result in corrective events that could have a material effect on the Group's assets and
liabilities as of December 31, 2020.
For the year ended 31 December 2020, the Group's profit amounted to EUR 4,285 thousand. Thus, as at
31 December 2020, current liabilities of the Group exceeded its current assets by EUR 1,755 thousand. De-
spite the positive indicators in 2020, the Group could be impacted by the factors and risks that will make
doubtful the possibility of the Group to continue in the future on a going concern basis.
The agricultural sector, in which the Group operates, is prone to loss due to the growth of prices of agricultural
raw materials and fuel for agricultural machinery. Conditions and risks existing at the macroeconomic level in
the Group's environment can cause repeated losses in the future and make doubtful the possibility of the
Group to continue as a going concern.
The Group applies a strategy to minimize the impact of these conditions and risks. Attracting of foreign invest-
ment, the expansion of the distribution market and the use of elite breeds of seed crops, in the opinion of
Management, are measures that will help in overcoming the financial crisis in Ukraine.
Management of the Group believes that has all factors for provision the going concern in the future. The going
concern basis is appropriate for preparation of the financial statements in the absence of significant uncertain-
ties that are beyond the control of the Group and could make doubtful the possibility of the Group to continue
as a going concern.
